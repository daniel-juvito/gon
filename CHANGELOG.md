# Changelog

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Field contracts.** A `!T` field is an invariant of its declared storage
  location. Enforced at three local sites only:
  - **Construction (GN002):** zero-value containment walk over struct,
    embedded, fixed array, and anonymous types; stops at every indirection
    boundary (`*T`, `[]T`, `map`, `chan`, `interface`, `func`).
  - **Mutation (GN001):** explicit `nil` assigned into a `!T` field
    (`s.Client = nil`). Ordinary values remain accepted (conservative).
  - **Selector (non-nil source):** selecting a `!T` field yields a non-nil
    source for immediate use (GW001 on nil comparison).
- **`.gna` `types:` section.** External packages may declare field contracts:
  ```yaml
  types:
    Config:
      fields:
        Client: "!*http.Client"
  ```
- Spec: [docs/rfc-field-contracts.md](docs/rfc-field-contracts.md).

### Compatibility

- `.gna` schema remains **1** (no format change; `types:` was already
  syntactically open under schema 1).
- Programs accepted by v1.1 remain accepted unless they construct or mutate
  a value that violates a newly annotated `!` field.
- No flow analysis, no path sensitivity, no reconstruction of object state.
- Ordinary value into `!T` field remains accepted.

> Gon v1.2 makes `!T` fields storage invariants checked at construction,
> mutation, and selector use — still local and non-flow-sensitive.

### Changed

- `gon version` reports `1.2.0`.
- Scope document updated for v1.2 semantics.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Return-value contracts.** An explicitly annotated `!T` result position
  (in `.gna` or a local Gon signature) becomes a non-nil source at its
  immediate use site (`:=` or `var` without an explicit type). Observable via
  GW001 on nil comparison.
- Spec: [docs/rfc-return-value-contracts.md](docs/rfc-return-value-contracts.md).

### Compatibility

- `.gna` schema remains **1** (no format change).
- Ordinary (unannotated) values assigned to `!T` remain accepted.
- No flow analysis, no conditional contracts, no propagation through
  conversion / type assertion / assignment from names.
- Explicit type on a binding always wins over a return contract.

> Gon v1.1 adds explicit return-value contracts without introducing flow
> analysis. Annotated `!T` return positions become non-nil sources at their
> immediate use sites; existing ordinary-value acceptance remains unchanged.

### Changed

- `gon version` reports `1.1.0`.
- Scope document updated for v1.1 semantics.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-16

Initial public release.

- Local non-flow-sensitive nilability checks (`!T`).
- External packages via `.gna` + module-aware `go/packages`.
- Conservative reference annotations for `io` and `os`.
